## Installation

To open the app on Mac/Linux, start a terminal window at the "trivia" directory and run `npm start`. Alternatively, the app can be viewed online [here](answer10.web.app).

## How to use

Click on the home screen image or the game tab in navigation to start a new game. Click an answer to select it. Points are displayed to the bottom left of the possible answers. A correct answer will increment points based on difficulty, as follows:

Easy ... 100 points
Medium ... 200 points
Hard ... 300 points

Incorrect answers subtract 50 points from the player's score. After an answer is chosen, a "next" button will appear that takes the player to the next question. The Options page allows a specific category and/or difficulty for all questions to be selected. The leaderboard is currently populated through local storage, and will only show scores acheived on that machine.

## Built With
